# AR6SNOW_MODEL
The code and data included in this repository are intended to support analysis of hydroclimatic processes at a local governance scale. 

This repository includes all code required to processes data for evaluating exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, vulnerability,
& resilience in 13 local governance units in the western US. 

The CMIP5 Variables sub-repository contains all code and lookup tables for processing CMIP5 SWE and runoff as well as additional code
for processing MizuRoute data. Data can be accessed here https://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/dcpInterface.html#About 
or by emailing UCAR.

The CropScape sub-respository contains all code and lookup tables for processing CropScape data and bias correcting pixels based
on published error supermatrices. Data can be accessed here: https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/cropscape-cropland-data-layer

The USBR Demand sub-repository contains all code and lookup tables for processing USBR estimates of historical and future NIWR, including
ETO which is used to estimate future reservoir evaporation.  Data can be accessed here: https://usbr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=f08c6c521fe64e259b3da9771b948204

The ESAC_Model sub-repository contains all code and information required to replicate figures and analysis conducted in 
a manuscript currently under review by Gordon et al. (2023). Included in this respository are the shapefiles constructed
for each Local Governance Unit.
